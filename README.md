# ESP8266-Redstone

A simple lamp styled like MineCraft redstone ore. Based off of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3104170 which is in turn based on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:526104. Main new components are a bracket for an ESP8266 microcontroller, and simpler diffusers which can be printed as flat sheets and glued to the internal faces. Made for a friend's birthday.
